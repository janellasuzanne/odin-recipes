# odin-recipes

odin-recipes is a basic recipe website written purely using HTML. It is the first project from one of The Odin Project's "Foundations" courses--"HTML Foundations".

Completing this project will reinforce the knowledge, skills, and tools that were introduced and taught from the first up to the last lesson in the "HTML Foundations" section including, but not limited to, basic HTML and proper use of the Git VCS.
