            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients, and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Place sweet potatoes in a large saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat, drain, and mash.</li>
                <li>Place mashed sweet potatoes in a large bowl. Add brown sugar, butter, orange juice, and cinnamon; mix with an electric mixer until blended.</li>
                <li>Spread evenly into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Sprinkle marshmallows over top.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is heated through and marshmallows are puffed and golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Cook's Note</h3>
            <p>Stir a pinch of ground cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger into sweet potato mixture for a spiced version.</p>
            <p>If you only have regular or large marshmallows, halve or quarter them before topping the casserole so they melt and brown evenly.</p>
