            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 7x11-inch baking dish. Place crumbled cornbread in a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and celery and sauté until soft, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add sautéed onion and celery to the crumbled cornbread. Stir in chicken stock, eggs, sage, salt, and pepper until well combined. Pour dressing into the prepared baking dish.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until dressing just starts to turn golden brown around the edges, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Cook's Note</h3>
            <p>If you prefer a softer dressing, bake it covered loosely with foil. Sometimes I bake it in muffin tins for individual servings.</p>

            <p>Start with less sage if you're unsure—flavors intensify as the dressing bakes.</p>

            <p>Stir in 1 cup chopped apples or pecans for variation.</p>
